### The **initial size of data structures** depends on the type of data structure being used and how it is implemented. 

---

### **1. Arrays**  
- **Size:** The size of an array is fixed when it is created.  
- **Example:** If you create an array of size 5, it can hold exactly 5 elements.  
- **Note:**  
  - You cannot increase or decrease the size of an array dynamically (in most languages like C or Java).  
  - In Python, a list (dynamic array) can grow or shrink as needed.

---

### **2. Stacks**  
- **Size:**  
  - **Static Implementation:** The size of the stack is fixed when using an array to implement it.  
  - **Dynamic Implementation:** The stack can grow and shrink dynamically when implemented with a linked list or dynamic arrays.  
- **Example:**  
  - A stack with a maximum size of 10 can hold up to 10 elements.  

---

### **3. Queues**  
- **Size:**  
  - Similar to stacks, queues can have a fixed size (static) or dynamic size depending on their implementation.  
- **Static Queue Example:**  
  - A queue of size 5 can hold 5 elements, after which it will overflow.  
- **Dynamic Queue Example:**  
  - In dynamic queues (like in Python), the size can grow as elements are added.

---

### **4. Linked Lists**  
- **Size:**  
  - Linked lists do not have a fixed size when created.  
  - You can add as many nodes as needed, limited only by available memory.  
- **Example:**  
  - When a linked list is created, it starts empty, and nodes are added dynamically.

---

### **5. Trees**  
- **Size:**  
  - A tree does not have a fixed size at creation.  
  - Nodes are added or removed dynamically.  
- **Example:**  
  - A binary tree starts empty, and you add nodes one by one.  

---

### **6. Graphs**  
- **Size:**  
  - The size of a graph depends on the number of nodes (vertices) and edges when it is initialized.  
  - It can grow dynamically by adding nodes and edges.  
- **Example:**  
  - A graph starts with no vertices and edges. You can add as many as needed.

---

### **7. Abstract Data Type (ADT)**  
- **Size:**  
  - The size of an ADT is dependent on the concrete data structure used to implement it (e.g., stacks, queues, lists).  
  - It is defined by operations and does not specify a fixed size.  
- **Example:**  
  - A Stack ADT may be implemented with a dynamic array or a linked list, both of which allow dynamic sizing.

#### **Operations:**
  - **Push, Pop** for Stack ADT.
  - **Enqueue, Dequeue** for Queue ADT.
  - **Insert, Delete** for List ADT.

### **8. Single Linked List**  
- **Size:**  
  - A single linked list starts empty (size 0).  
  - It can grow dynamically as new nodes are added.  
- **Example:**  
  - Nodes are added dynamically with each new insertion.

---

### **9. Double Linked List**  
- **Size:**  
  - A double linked list also starts empty (size 0).  
  - Nodes can be added dynamically like in a single linked list, but with links in both directions.  
- **Example:**  
  - A node is added at the end or beginning, and links to both the next and previous nodes are adjusted.

---

### **10. Set**  
- **Size:**  
  - A set typically starts empty (size 0) and can grow dynamically as elements are added.  
- **Example:**  
  - A set is used to store unique elements (e.g., `{1, 2, 3}`).  

---

### **11. Map (or Dictionary)**  
- **Size:**  
  - A map starts with size 0 and grows dynamically as key-value pairs are added.  
- **Example:**  
  - A map can store key-value pairs, such as `{"apple": 1, "banana": 2}`.

---

### **12. Tuples**  
- **Size:**  
  - A tuple has a fixed size upon creation. Once created, the size cannot change.  
- **Example:**  
  - A tuple could be `(1, 2, "hello")`, and its size cannot be modified after creation.
