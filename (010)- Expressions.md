### **1. Infix Expression**
Infix is the way we usually write math expressions. The **operator** (like `+` or `-`) is placed **between** the numbers (operands).

- **Example**:  
  `A + B`  
  Here, the operator `+` is between `A` and `B`.

#### Key Points:
- We use parentheses `()` to show which operation to do first.
- The order of operations tells us which operation to do first (like multiplication before addition).
- Examples:
  - `A + B * C`
  - `(A + B) * C`

---

### **2. Prefix Expression (Polish Notation)**
In prefix notation, the **operator** comes **before** the numbers (operands).

- **Example**:  
  `+ A B`  
  Here, the operator `+` is before `A` and `B`.

#### Key Points:
- No parentheses are needed. The order is decided by the position of the operator and numbers.
- For example, `A + B * C` in infix becomes `+ A * B C` in prefix.

---

### **3. Postfix Expression (Reverse Polish Notation)**
In postfix notation, the **operator** comes **after** the numbers.

- **Example**:  
  `A B +`  
  Here, the operator `+` is after `A` and `B`.

#### Key Points:
- Like prefix, no parentheses are needed. The order is clear by the position of the operator and numbers.
- For example, `A + B * C` in infix becomes `A B C * +` in postfix.

### **Conversion Between Notations**

To switch between infix, prefix, and postfix expressions, we follow some steps. This is helpful when we want to evaluate math expressions in computers.

#### **Infix to Prefix**:
1. Reverse the expression.
2. Convert it to postfix.
3. Reverse the postfix expression again to get the prefix.

#### **Infix to Postfix**:
1. Use a stack to hold operators.
2. Read the expression and follow these steps:
   - Add numbers directly to the result.
   - Push operators to the stack (following rules of precedence).
3. Pop the remaining operators from the stack and add them to the result.

### **Example Conversion**

Let’s see how to convert `A + B * C`.

---

#### **Infix to Prefix (Step-by-Step)**

Infix: `A + B * C`

1. **Step 1: Reverse the expression**:  
   Reversed expression: `C * B + A`

2. **Step 2: Convert the reversed expression to postfix**:  
   Process the reversed expression `C * B + A` from right to left:

   - `C` → Operand, so **add it to the output**.
   - `*` → Operator, so **push it onto the stack**.
   - `B` → Operand, so **add it to the output**.
   - `+` → Operator, check stack: since `*` has higher precedence, **pop `*` from the stack and add it to the output**. Then **push `+` onto the stack**.
   - `A` → Operand, so **add it to the output**.

   **Postfix Expression (Reversed)**: `C B * A +`

3. **Step 3: Reverse the postfix expression** to get the final prefix expression:  
   Reversed expression: `+ A * B C`

**Prefix Expression**: `+ A * B C`

---

#### **Infix to Postfix (Step-by-Step)**

Infix: `A + B * C`

1. **Step 1: Start with an empty stack** and an empty list for the output.

2. **Step 2: Process the expression from left to right**:
   - `A` → Operand, so **add it to the output**.
   - `+` → Operator, so **push it onto the stack**.
   - `B` → Operand, so **add it to the output**.
   - `*` → Operator, since `*` has higher precedence than `+`, **push it onto the stack**.
   - `C` → Operand, so **add it to the output**.

   **Output so far**: `A B C`
   **Stack so far**: `+ *`

3. **Step 3: Pop all remaining operators from the stack**:
   - Pop `*` from the stack and add it to the output.
   - Pop `+` from the stack and add it to the output.

   **Final Output (Postfix)**: `A B C * +`

---

### **Summary**

- **Infix**: Operators are between the numbers (e.g., `A + B`).
- **Prefix**: Operators are before the numbers (e.g., `+ A B`).
- **Postfix**: Operators are after the numbers (e.g., `A B +`).
